The story is about a fictional or mythical library where a vast number of books exist. It has hexagonal shaped rooms that contain the books, the library has every book written and will be written by humanity, even books that once existed or books using languages that never existed. 


>  In the entrance way hangs a mirror, which faithfully duplicates appearances. People are in the habit of inferring from this mirror that the Library is not infinite (if it really were, why this illusory duplication?)

The author here says that there's a mirror at the entrance of the room which duplicates appearance and the library. People infer from it that the library is not infinite because if it was, there would be no need for such illusory duplication.
The meaning of this is the life and death cycle, as humans we see people die and others live and the cycle continue since almost 200,000 years ago, because of that we tend to think that life will continue infinitely (unless we destroy ourselves). Though, since Bores mentions that people know it just an illusion I believe he thinks about the religious books about doomsday and the end of life. 


>Man, the imperfect librarian, may be the work of chance or of malevolent demiurges
> the universe, with its elegant endowment of shelves, of enigmatic volumes, of indefatigable ladders for the voyager, and of privies for the seated librarian, can only be the work of a god.

The man represents the human in life that could be the work of chance or god.
The author say that universe with its elegance and complexity can only be work of a god and not chance.
