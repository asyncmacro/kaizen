# Pure Functions

## What is a Pure Function

A pure function is a function that adheres to two principles: **Deterministic** and **No side effects** 

* **Determistic:** given the same inputs the function would return the same value.
* **No side effects:** The function doesn't invoke any side effects such as: 
    * make HTTP requests
    * change global values
    * change arguments passed to the function
    * change program's state in any way.
