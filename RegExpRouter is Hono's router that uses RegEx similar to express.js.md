# The RegExpRouter

Although this router may be similar to Express' router, it is quite different (and more performant). Express' uses `path-to-regexp` library for route matching and uses linear matching. Hono on the other hand has its own built-in RegExpRouter which compiles down all the routes into a single regular expression.

When a request comes in it performs a single match against the built regular expression, the result is then used to determine which handler is more specific to handle the request.

It comes also with some limitations: [[Hono's RegExpRouter Limitations]]
