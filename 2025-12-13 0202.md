A fancy restaurant in Manila City l, the time was arount 8:15 pm. I was sitting at cup of coffee I had ordered earlier, it already turned cold yet she hasn't arived. She's a girl I met only for quite some time and we finally decided to go on a date, what I like about her is she's mentally mature and loyal. I take a look at my phone screen to see to time, it's 8:20 pm. The door opens and It's her. She takes a scan at the restaurant and I wave my hand so she finds me easily, she waves back and approach. She was wearing a black dress with high heels she looks really beautiful in person than on pictures, really gorgeous. She's a morena girl that looks like 5'4 I kept following with my eyes until she sat on the table with me.

"I am really sorry, there was a trafic" she said, "It's fine, don't worry about it " I say with a smile. I ask her "Hmm, what you wanna eat?", she looks at the menu and says "some of this is really good but really expensive" filipinas can be really good wives because they tend to be good financial managers.

"You don't have to worry about it, just order what you want to eat" I reply, when takes a look and choose some food and it seems like she's in diet or something. I ask her "Are you really not that hungry?" wondering if she ate something earlier. 

"Now that's a secret you'll understand later" she responds with a wink and I look at her really clueless. I look at the menu to see what I'm going to order and call for the waiter and he takes our orders.
While waiting for our orders we talk about different topics and it turns out she has suffered from being cheated on different times in her life, I guess it must have been hard for her 



 met lot while ago on the internet she's not that tall, with skinny build but somehow sexy and cute face. After waiting for few minutes, the restaurant's door opens and she comes in with that black dress, I just sat admiring her looks until she looks my way and waves to me, I wave back to her.

She comes and sit on the tables, "Hey, I'm sorry for the wait" she says.
"Uhm, it's okay don't worry" i respond while still just admiring her looks.
The waiter comes in and we order some food, and it was really delicious to be honest. 

The date was also great, we had lots of things in common, she got a good humor. It's not first time to talk, but its first date of it's kind. So, after dinner I pay for the dessert and We go out for a bit of walk then I ask her "uhm, Ii don't like the fact you going home alone, oo how about I walk you home?". 
She give me a bit of a surprised look and grin, "Uhm, you know, my roommate is living with me, Let's go to your house".
