# Story: On a rainy day

I wake up to the sound of a phone continuously ringing "Ooph, who is it at this hour?" saying annoyed by the phone because I spend the last night awake until 2 AM, I answer without even looking at the name asking "Hello, Who is it?". an energetic sound comes out of the phone "WHAT YOU MEAN WHO IS IT?" that sound was my girlfriend's voice, she's always energetic meanwhile me being the lazy kind. I reply "Oh I'm sorry babe I just work up"

"Hum, fine, just hurry up I'm waiting for you, Love you" She responds and hangs up. I get up swiftly, brush up my teeth and hair and go to meet with her.

I get to the place where we're supposed to meet and there are a lot of people, I turn around and I find her there waiting she looks like an elementary school student with that height. I approach her and Oh god, I don't think there's a way to describe her fully and fairly. She's funny, mature, jealous and sexy.

We spend our day going out to coffee, the shopping for some stuff and having a dinner at night in a restaurant.

On out way home it start raining heavily so we sit in a chair waiting for the rain to stop. she starts to shiver of cold, I say "See, you should have brought more clothes" and she hit me with the generic "hehe, my feet hurt from high heels too"

I get up of the chair, give her my jacket and and take off her high heels. Her feet are so small, her legs are like a made of snow, white and so cold. I give her feet a little bit of massage, and let her wear my shoes because they're more comfortable. 

Suddenly the rain stops, so I ask her "Wanna go to my place?" she responds "Hell Yeah!" she seems a bit drunk from the alcohol she drank at the restaurant. I take her high heels in my left hands while holding her hand with my right and we walk home.
