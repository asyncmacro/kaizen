A fancy restaurant in Manila City l, the time was around 8:15 pm. I was sitting at cup of coffee I had ordered earlier, it already turned cold yet she hasn't arrived. She's a girl I met only for quite some time and we finally decided to go on a date, what I like about her is she's mentally mature and loyal. I take a look at my phone screen to see to time, it's 8:20 pm. The door opens and It's her. She takes a scan at the restaurant and I wave my hand so she finds me easily, she waves back and approach. She was wearing a black dress with high heels she looks really beautiful in person than on pictures, really gorgeous. She's a morena girl that looks like 5'4 I kept following with my eyes until she sat on the table with me.

"I am really sorry, there was a traffic " she said, "It's fine, don't worry about it " I say with a smile. I ask her "Hmm, what you wanna eat?", she looks at the menu and says "some of this is really good but really expensive" Philippines' girls can be really good wives because they tend to be good financial managers.

"You don't have to worry about it, just order what you want to eat" I reply, when takes a look and choose some food and it seems like she's in diet or something. I ask her "Are you really not that hungry?" wondering if she ate something earlier. 

"Now that's a secret you'll understand later" she responds with a wink and I look at her really clueless. I look at the menu to see what I'm going to order and call for the waiter and he takes our orders.
While waiting for our orders we talk about different topics and it turns out she has suffered from being cheated on different times in her life, I guess it must have been hard for her to be cheated on like that, what a horrible person would hurt such an angelic person. While I'm lost in the thought I kept just admiring her looks.

"Hey, do you hear me" she said looking at me, "uh, I'm sorry I was just thinking about something"

"How about you, What about your love story?" She asked wondering about my past relationships. "I don't know, I always end up being ghosted or misunderstood. It feels like my thoughts were meant for just one person but "



 met lot while ago on the internet she's not that tall, with skinny build but somehow sexy and cute face. After waiting for few minutes, the restaurant's door opens and she comes in with that black dress, I just sat admiring her looks until she looks my way and waves to me, I wave back to her.

She comes and sit on the tables, "Hey, I'm sorry for the wait" she says.
"Uhm, it's okay don't worry" I respond while still just admiring her looks. It didn't take much time for the food to come in, as we were eating she was talking about her past and how she doesn't trust easily because of what happened to her before and how she got cheated to twice.

I really don't understand how could some people be this heartless to this kind of girls, What would you expect more from a woman? she's already stunning, loyal and she is mature. She was just talking and I am listening and thinking about her she really must have been too hard, it would take her a lot to trust someone else maybe she's sitting here with me while still uncomfortable.

"Hey, I wanna know about you more too. What about your past relationships" she asks while smiling. "Uh I don't know, I think I've been with two only, truly loved one yet I think destiny had other choices for us haha" I say While smiling even though there's something inside that feels different, They say teenage years love is hard to forget not quite sure about that yet wishing it is something not true because it's hard to live with a scar inside that can be open by few words or questions.

I think we really click because we spent most of our time talking about how the current society is fucked up, they really normalized cheating and having multiple partners I really wonder how their marriage would look like it's honestly scary and heartbreaking. As the time pass by, we finished our food, our dessert and our topics has not ended yet. we head to the cashier and I pay for it and we go outside, she asks me if I'm good at technology and my good listener personality turn off and I get to the talking mode. As we're walking I keep talking and talking about this topic because it's my passion since childhood. What started as a simple yes or no question ended with a long talking about technology and history and after I'm done over-explaining things she smiles give a slight laugh and say "So you're a nerd aren't you?". Well, she's right actually so I respond "Hmm, you can say so".

I say to myself, who would think such a person would be traumatized and with trust issues. I check my phone for hour and it was 10 PM it was kind of late for a girl to go home alone even with taxi, So I ask her "Want me to accompany you home?" and I wish I didn't ask something like that. The way she looked at me, it was mix of sad, scared and a helpless girl but thankfully I realized so I continue saying "It's just seem to be pretty late and I think it would be dangerous for you to go home". 
Her look suddenly changed and she seem to misunderstand me earlier and she reply "Oooh, I thought that... Never mind" with a smile that already look like she's just pretending. "It's fine, you don't have to explain I understand" I respond while already understanding her just from her eyes, It takes me long to understand people but I was able to understand all of her thought so swiftly, I think she must've thought I want a one night stand with her. well, I don't think I support the idea of sex with no love because it's a language that can be spoken best when two souls are already connected other than that, it's just two dead bodies touching each other.

"Yeah, I would love to" she says while really relieved. "Well, let's go then" I respond while looking around for a taxi, I spot one and call for it. we get inside and she tells him about her destination. As we're inside we kept being quiet I don't understand why but I was lost in my thoughts about how bad her life could've been, not bad but I think it broke her trust. As we arrive I see what looked like a dark and empty alley like the ones you usually see in horror or crime movies so I ask in order to confirm "Are you going in there?" I was really wondering if she's really planning on going there alone and as I expected, she's going there. As she steps out of the car and so do I. The taxi goes out and she looked scared but also worried about me. "Why did you step out? it will take you some time to find a taxi at this time" She asks me, well she's right but something tells me to just make sure she's safe.

"I don't know, just worried about you. can I walk you home, I'll go once you're inside" I say to her making sure she understands what my intentions are. "You don't have to worry about me I punch real strong" she says to me trying to give impression she's strong and can stand for her self, she's probably right maybe she could punch good. "Fear is uncontrollable, when you're scared all of your strength vanishes in thin air" I say to her while looking her in the eyes and with no further talking I pretend on giving her a punch and she guards her self so poorly and give a slight scream, I say to her "See, I told you". I hold her hand and walk her down the alley.

Once we reach the her home I tell her "Well, I think now my job has been fulfilled see you later" I give her a little bit of a goodbye hug and walk away, as I was walking I hear her say "Hey, wait" I respond "Hmm, can I help you with anything?"  wondering if she's alright. "well, can you stay with me. If you don't mind" she looks like a bit scared but I accept her offer and we get inside.
