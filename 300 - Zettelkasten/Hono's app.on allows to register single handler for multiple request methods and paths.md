# How to use `on` Method for More Specific Routing

Even though Hono provides two ways of handling routes (see: [[Hono.<get,post,...> allows to register route handlers and middlewares|How to Register a Single Route]] and [[Hono.all allows handler to be registered for all type of methods|Register a Catch All Route]]). Sometimes you'd want to an in-between path, maybe register a handler that works only on two or three methods. This is where the `on` method comes for.

the `on` framework is defined as `app.on(method|method[], path|path[], handler|middleware...)`. The only difference from the other methods is that it takes a method or an array of methods as the first argument. `method` refers to any HTTP method.

```typescript
app.on(['get', 'post', 'delete'], '/hello', (c) => {
  return c.text('Hello')
})
```

This route handler will run on GET, POST and DELETE requests matching the route.
