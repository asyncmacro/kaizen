# How to Create Custom Not Found Handler in Hono Framework

Hono gives the developer the power to customize the response in case of a not found. this handler will run when the request is accessing a route that's not defined:

```ts
app.notFound((c) => c.text('Oops! not found', 404))
app.get('/hello', (c) => c.text('Hello'))
```

Now if there's a request other than `/hello` it will return `Oops! not found` with status 404
