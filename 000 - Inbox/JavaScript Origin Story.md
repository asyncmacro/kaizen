Brendan Eich was a Operating Systems person and woeking at Netscape when they wanted him to create language (JavaScript) before their next launch.

Since brendan eich loved programming languages, he wanted to base JavaScript on Lisp but his managers refused.

Javascript first name was mocha, then livescript and no one liked both names, so they named it javascript.

In 1997 javascript was submitted to ecma international and became ECMAScript.

In 1998 microsoft started developing concept of XMLHttpRequest since before you'd have to do full page request and there's no concept of requests in JavaScript. In 2005 it was given the name AJAX (Asynchronous JSON and XML)

jQuery was first library to try making working with JavaScript better. 

In 2008 Chrome came out with JIT (Just-in-time) compilation. And other browsers followed.

One of the first bundlers was browserify but webpack had more features.
