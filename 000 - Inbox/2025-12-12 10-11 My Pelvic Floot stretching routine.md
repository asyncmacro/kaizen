My daily routine of stretches is like the following: 

* 10 minutes of Reclined Bound Angle, this stretch opens the pelvic floor and I do minimum of 10 minutes and sometimes more
* 2 minutes of Janu Sirsasana on each side, This stretches the muscles on the back of my legs such as hamstrings. I try to keep my back straight and lean forward.
* 2 minutes of couch stretch for each side, this targets the muscles at the front of my thighs.
* A single 2 minutes of standing hamstrings stretching for improving mobility and stretch better in case I did not stretch will in Janu Sirsasana.

**Rules to follow;**
* Try to do it twice a day (morning/night)
* If in busy day, do it once. Extra busy? Just reclined bound angle before sleep.
* Try not to do kegels during the day or in bathroom.
