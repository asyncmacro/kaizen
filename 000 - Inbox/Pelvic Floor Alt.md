| **Breathing in Reclined Bound Angle** | 5-10 mins   | Lie on your back with soles of feet together (use pillows under knees for comfort), inhale deeply into the belly to gently **bulge the pelvic floor downward** (Reverse Kegel), keeping the exhale passive. | This is your primary **down-training** exercise; focus on total release.               |
| **Janu Sirsasana (The Hybrid)**       | 2 mins/side | Sit with one leg straight and the opposite foot tucked, then hinge forward from the hips over the straight leg, ensuring a deep stretch in the hamstring and inner thigh.                                   | Stretches hamstring (APT correction) and opens the pelvic floor outlet simultaneously. |
| **Couch Stretch (Modified)**          | 2 mins/side | Kneel near a wall with one shin/foot against it and the other leg forward, then **squeeze the glute of the back leg and tuck the tailbone** strongly to drive the stretch into the hip flexor.              |                                                                                        |
