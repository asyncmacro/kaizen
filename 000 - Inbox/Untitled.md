My daily routine of stretches is like the following: 
* 10 minutes of Reclined Bound Angle, this stretch opens the pelvic floor and I do minimum of 10 minutes and sometimes more
* 2 minutes of Janu Sirsasana on each side, This stretches the muscles on the back of my legs such as hamstrings. I try to keep my back straight and lean forward.
* 2 minutes of couch stretch for each side, this targets the muscles at the front of my thighs.
* A single 2 minutes of standing hamstrings stretching for improving mobility and stretch better in case I did not stretch will in Janu Sirsasana.

I try to do this routine twice a day but I'm case I miss days I do my best to do it at least once a day.
