I write you a 20 letters about you, how I miss you and how I crave your existence in my little life. You left this little universe of mine and you left your smell along the way. 

You may ask, why 20 letters and why not more or less. Because 20 is the day our story started, our little love story. The 20th of April, just after 6 days of my birthday and 19 days after first time talking to you. It's the only way I can express myself, my love, my regrets since I wasn't able to express it when I was with you because I was scared of expressing my feelings too broadly
