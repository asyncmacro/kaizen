# Reminder App

Minimalist, simple, yet powerful app for setting reminder quotes that you will be reminded of through widget.

## How to use?

**The widget:** it shows saved reminders on the app randomly, it displays it with different backgrounds, text colors and font types.

**The App:** a simple clean UI, the user sees list of saved reminders that can be deleted, or edited. A button for adding new reminders for display. The UI must be clean, straightforward, and with no distractions.

**The "Draft" Screen:** A single, focused input field. Big font, no distractions. You type 20 characters, hit "Add," and it joins the pool.

**The "Collection" List:** A simple list of your active reminders. Swipe left to delete, tap to edit.

## Select and share

to avoid input fatigue, a user can select text and share it with the app. it will be added to the list.

## Default state

to avoid empty state trap, we add 'Stop. Take deep breath' to the list then it's the user's choice to delete or add

## About adding animations

it can be good to animate text but it can be a cons. 
for example, a light animation of text appearing to the list upon clicking Add, though it must be light to keep simplicity, no animation unless needed

No animation on entrance

## The palette

**The Palette:** * **Morning:** Soft cream background with charcoal Serif font.
- **Afternoon:** Sage green background with white Sans-Serif font.
- **Night:** Deep navy background with a thin, elegant Monospace font

## Dynamic Type Scaling

Since reminders can be of different lengths, the text size will be of different sizes.

if user types 'Breathe' the size will be bigger than when user type 'Stop. Take a deep breath'

## Nudge feature

Because user can forget to update list, there will be a nudge feature for it where a notification will appear when list hasn't been updated for while (1 week).

the time between each reminder will increase exponentially if user clicks ignore, if user updates it will be back to 1 week.

The user can disable the nudge feature.

Add card for asking user to enable the nudge feature, if user dismiss the card the nudge will be disable.

## One-note case

if user has only one note, the widget will still be updated because if it were static it would have been forgotten.

## Optional features


**Gamified (optional):** a click to the widget confirms the user has done the act, it will *moment counter* which is a counter for how many times you did something, it doesn't reset, doesn't create anxiety
