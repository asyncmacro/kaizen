When our brains procrastinate something important to us, it's not because we're bad but because they're doing what they're trained to do which is *save energy* .

For that, there are two reasons:

## 1. Emotional pushback 

Because the goal or task seems big, our brain try to avoid it things like "**I need to clean the house**" will look like a big tasks and our brains try to avoid it. 

## 2. Save ego

When you say "**I am not a math person**" your brain actually believes it and try to avoid even opening the book

## Strategies

### 1. The two minutes trick 

Instead of saying "**I must study for 8 hours**" start small like open the book or read one paragraph, something you can do in 2 minutes or less. Doing that will ease the brain into doing more of the task think of it as warming up your brain for the task.

### 2. Preparation 

Instead of going to gym, just wear your gym clothes and the water bottle. This is similar to the 2 minutes trick as it gets you ready to do more.
