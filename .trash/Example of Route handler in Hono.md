# Example of Route handler in Hono

A handler is a function that runs on the specified request (see: [[Route handlers are functions meant to be executed for each incoming request]]) here's an example of a route handler in Hono:

```typescript
app.get('/api/hello', (c) => {
  return c.json({ response: 'Hello, Hono!' })
})
```

In this example, we setup `/api/hello` as a route that accepts GET request, it returns a JSON response with `response` as `Hello, Hono!`

the `c` argument contains details about the request and methods to help respond to the request and set headers/cookies
