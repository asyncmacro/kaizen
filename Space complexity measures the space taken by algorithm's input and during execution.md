# Space complexity measures the space taken by algorithm's input and during execution

Space Complexity refers to the amount of space taken by the algorithm's input and any auxiliary space during execution. similar to [[Time Complexity Measures Algorithm Performance Relative to Input Size|time complexity]] it usually written as O(1), O(n)...etc.
