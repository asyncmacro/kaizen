# Natural Numbers $\mathbb{N}$

## 1. What are natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$

*Natural* or *counting* numbers are the set of numbers we usually use in our daily life, things like counting when playing hide-and-seek, enumerating items, etc.

This number system started around 100 centuries ago in the middle east where human needed ways to represent such values when trading doing commerce.

Natural numbers start from 0 to infinity and can be represented in the following set: $$ \{ 1, 2, 3, ... \} $$
The ellipsis (...) represent the incrementing numbers
