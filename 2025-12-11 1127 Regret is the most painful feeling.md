They say the breakup pain is the most painful feeling to a human being but to me it's regret. It is the feeling of losing something that was once dear to you because of the ego, not appreciating it the love that was given to you enough. Every day I spend some of my time regretting every word I said in the heat of the moment, my tongue twitches as if it was put on acid, my hands shake when I remember I used them to seal my destiny.

My heart can only think about one thing, what was once mine is for someone else now. The lips that I once dreamed of kissing are now for him to kiss, The eyes that I spent nights and nights staring at will be available to him to gaze at when he say the word I love you.

Will you give him what you gave me? will he be your sanctuary just like I was yours once? will he hold you closer to him hearing your voice, your breaths and your heart.

I will no longer be your universe anymore, I feel a mixture of sharp pain and happiness, now you're happier than ever but I'm no longer the main character in your life story.

My brain struggles to remember details about my life but capable to remember our memories, every valentine I remember the little girl that wanted to be your valentine and smile, every time I look at the beach and remember the day we planned for our wedding to be on the beach. I remember the time you told me you'd be at the beach if you leave the house...Now where can I find you? is there somewhere I can find you at to just hold you one last time and tell you what I couldn't say for years. 

It's too late now to change the flow of time, I wish I knew sooner...you're now the only place I could see you at is the place where the only scent of you is left, memories is where I could find you. The place that makes me struggle everyday is my only place I can remember you.

Imagination is where I can hold you, kiss you and tell you what I should have said, the only safe place left for me to live in.
