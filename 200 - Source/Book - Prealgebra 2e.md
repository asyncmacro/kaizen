## 1. Summary (My Words)

(Write a high-level summary of the entire source. What is the central argument or thesis? Do not put atomic ideas here; this is for context.)

## 2. Key Takeaways & Quotes

(This is where you extract the specific ideas that you plan to process into permanent Zettels. Use bullet points or quotes.)

- "Whole numbers are $\{1, 2, 3, ...\}$ the ... is called ellipsis which means _and so on_. They're also called counting numbers"
- "The discovery of $0$ was a big step in history of mathematics which lead to a new set of numbers called **whole number** that doesn't include numbers such as $\frac{1}{4}$ or $5.2$ "
- The author said: "Our number system is called a place value system because the value of a digit depends on its position" which means $123$ is not same as $321$
- "Place value is used to name a number like $3,512$ which is \*three thousands and five hundreds and twelve"
- Rounding works by increasing the number based on the specific place value asked
- "A variable is a letter that represents a number or quantity whose value may change. A constant is a number whose value always stays the same."
- "An inequality is used in algebra to compare two quantities that may have different values."
- Idea of Zettel: "The different words of algebraic notations"
- Idea of Zettel: "{}[]\(\) are different ways of grouping"
- The author compared the difference between equation and expression between a phrase and sentence, idea of zettel "Expressions and Equations, definition and examples". _An expression is a number, a variable, or a combination of numbers and variables and operation symbols. An equation is made up of two expressions connected by an equal sign._
- Simplify expression with exponents means evaluating the expression and then finding represent it in exponents $a^n$ which means $n$ factors of $a$. $a$ is the base and $n$ is the exponent. both exponents $2$ and $3$ have special names (_squared_ and _cubed_)
- Idea of zettel: "Exponents definition and usage"
- Simplifying using order of operations is crucial for getting correct answers. Idea of zettel: "Order of Operations in Math is crucial"
- Author suggested way to remember it by using the phrase "**P**lease **E**xcuse **M**y **D**ear **A**unt **S**ally"
